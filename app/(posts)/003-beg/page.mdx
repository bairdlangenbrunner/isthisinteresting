The deli sandwich is a New York institution.

If you live here and have a stomach for bodega food, then you're probably familiar with the staples: chopped cheese; Reuben; chicken cutlet; chicken parm.

And if you work from home and live alone like me, sometimes a morning walk is the best way to make contact with humanity before the day ensues. What's more, if you happen to be going through some fierce personal shit, getting out of the apartment for a bacon, egg, and cheese (BEC) offers a certain transcendence that eludes easy description.

But I'm still going to try.

### Belly up

It's been about four months since I last sat down to work on this site. I had grand visions at first, telling myself I'd try to "make things" at a certain clip and build a small arsenal of projects by the end of 2024. And even though I rarely set attainable goals for myself, I really thought this was in reach.

But I've been in survival mode lately. My personal life took a pretty surprising series of turns starting around August, picking up a years-long arc that hasn't really let up yet. I've taken control of what I can, but my world has felt abruptly tentative. And until this week, I haven't been able to sit down and work on this. I've just been sad, and a little broken, and a lot unable to concentrate.

As time ticks on, I find myself reading more, crying less, and doomscrolling in a slightly more controlled way ‚Äî all of which are welcome changes. I'm not someone who dwells, and I know there's good shit to come. But it's been painstaking, and I know it can't be rushed, and that I have to sit and wade and build meaning.

I also need to eat meals and keep a stable appetite. And a surprising source of joy is the indeliberate quest I've embarked on to find my favorite BEC.

### Sight for sore eyes

This search started a few months ago. It was an early Monday morning, and I was lugging my suitcase up the stairs of the Clinton‚ÄìWashington AC stop. I was fresh off a red eye into JFK, and I sleep terribly on planes; I'm also a ravenous breakfast person, but I passed on the knockoff Hot Pocket they served in flight. So there I was, ferally hungry and bleary-eyed, when I reached street level and looked caddy corner at [Bergen Bagels](https://g.co/kgs/GLXAevW).

It was beckoning me.

Well, beckon isn't the best word. Bergen Bagels has three locations, and their Fulton shop has the kind of soulless expansiveness you'd expect from a suburban Dunkin' Donuts. It sits on the northwest corner of Fulton St and Washington Ave, and the side facing Fulton has floor-to-ceiling windows that gives both inside and outside a fishbowl effect, depending on where you're standing.

Inside, the pallette is off-white and mahogany brown. The floor is a cold gray tile patterned with a cognitively dissonant imitation of pine grain. There's a self-serve cooler filled with juice and soda, and two low tables, all dwarfed by high ceilings and the overexposed brightness of the space. If it weren't for the bagels hanging in baskets on the walls, or the small stadium of cream cheeses behind glass, you might think you were in a hospital.

But I'll cut to the chase, because what matters is that Bergen Bagels makes one of my favorite BECs.

### The Bergen effect

Whether you're charmed by its appearance or not, once you're inside, you feel taken care of. Even long lines move quickly, and pretty soon you're being helped by one of the handful of men wandering in a chaotic pattern behind the counter. Beyond rudimentary toasting and smearing, sandwiches are prepared behind the scenes, arriving through a small window in the back wall.

My order: BEC on a whole wheat everything bagel, toasted, with salt and pepper, which comes out to about $7.57. Add a small coffee for free on weekdays before 11am (and you should: the coffee here is a simple and never-burnt complement).

The bacon is dutifully crispy and chopped up in a way that lets you have some in every bite. The cheese seems to stay melty even after the sandwich cools down, if for some reason you don't finish it in one sitting. The egg is fine; it never has a leading role, and that's how it should be. In this way, the salt and pepper are crucial.

As bagel quality goes, I think these are some of the best in the city, and they really do beautiful things for a BEC. My personal pick, the whole wheat everything, is chewy, garlicky, and strictly savory, without even a hint of sweetness.

The shop is about a 10-minute walk from my apartment, and it's got a fantastic view of Fulton and its morning bustle. The division between outside and inside is almost vaporous at times, and the shop, with its giant windows, feels like a provisional community space.

There are regulars who stop to catch up with friends on both sides of the door. They seem to carry a decades-long awareness of this corner and its many lives. Some of them get bagels or coffee; some are just there for a quick embrace before they catch the B25 downtown.

Go alone and eat at one of the spartan counters overlooking Fulton. That morning, after a long red-eye flight, I did just that. The context of a BEC can be just as important as the sandwich itself, and at this Bergen Bagels, they pair perfectly.

### What's in a name

If I've offended anyone who thinks a BEC needs to be on some sort of bulkie roll, I don't care. The bread of a BEC is personal, and its name is generously agnostic to what the main ingredients get packaged in.

But I also appreciate that a standard deli BEC is very different from what you'd get in a bagel shop. You might chance upon a deli with decent bagels, but often, you're choosing among humbler options: some sort of roll; white or wheat or multigrain bread; a croissant.

{/* If I'm skipping the bagel, I like a multigrain or wheat bread BEC. Croissants and soft white breads seem to almost dissolve into the fat and heat of the bacon and cheese, and I like the bread to remain a buttress for the insides, not merge with them. I also like the slight bitterness that whole wheat bread brings to a sandwich. It's a conflict that  */}

Personal choices aside, I find that classic delis and bodegas offer a certain BEC intimacy that you don't get in a bagel shop. The griddle is visible through the glass cases, and you order directly from the cook, as if you're in someone's kitchen, getting your sandwich made the way it might be for their loved ones. And these people probably haven't worked in restaurants, but they've got hours and hours behind that griddle. They bring an invariable precision to any order; even if it's precisely wrong, it's still precise.

Then again, I think it's hard to find a truly bad BEC. Sure, sometimes an order gets screwed up, but it's still melty cheese and bacon and egg. How could this combo ever really be that offensive?

The more relevant measure of a BEC to me is the experience of waiting for it ‚Äî pacing around as it gets cooked; watching people order their own breakfasts in suits or sweats; weaving among kids grabbing snacks before school starts. Maybe you'll serve yourself from the deli's coffee altar. Hell, maybe you'll even play the lottery. Your chances are just as good as anyone's.

### The fog cutter

It's this time in particular ‚Äî the liminal space when my order is en route ‚Äî that has helped restart my diurnal healing process on rough mornings these past few months. It's become a meditative ritual, a spark plug for re-entry into the world at a point in the day when I've felt most broken and sad.

You see, I'm a morning person, and I wake up hungry. Breakfast is a religion for me, but sleep has been challenging lately, and I've either relied on sleeping pills that leave me sluggish at sunrise, or I bear the insomnia and wake up groggy in a different way. Forcing myself into the world, and interacting with a bodega, cooks off the fog.

And that's where I've found myself lately, trudging out of bed in the mornings to unfamiliar and increasingly distant delis and bagel shops, in search of the curative properties of the BEC, and of those windows in time that offer me levity, clarity, humanity.

The weather has been magically warm lately, too, so if the shop has no obvious seating, I take it to a nearby park and chow down at a bench. These morning hours coincide with off-leash times for dog owners, and I typically find myself defending my sandwich from eager and food-motivated pets. It's a treat for all of us, really.

Without being that deliberate about it, I tend to sit and read and be outside until I feel a little better and walk home. It used to take hours for this to happen. Sometimes it still does. But that's less and less true now.

{/* as I commune with the changing season, and I'm continually grateful for the buoying force of nature. */}

### Playing the record out

So what can I tell you about this search for my favorite BEC?

I can tell you it's geographically limited, and based more on what delis and shops I notice walking around Prospect Heights and its surroundings, rather than any sort of strategic approach.

I can tell you that Washington Ave is one of the most reliable main drags for a decent BEC near me. [Brooklyn Natural Market & Cafe](https://g.co/kgs/NBDisYr) serves fantastic bagels that are on the thinner side and take a backseat to the perfectly burnt bacon. [Burgos Deli Grocery](https://g.co/kgs/aTSVsBa) on Classon has one of the most no-frills BECs out there, with a surprisingly thankful owner and an intimacy worth experiencing.

If you prefer a thick and not exactly crispy slab of bacon on your BEC, I'd suggest [BK Bagel & Deli](https://g.co/kgs/6j1YQcq), where you can eat at the window counter and listen to the owner's Fairuz playlist. And if for some reason you want the eggs to take center stage, [N√ªrish](https://g.co/kgs/aE653WT) will give you that, but at a steep price.

I don't have a favorite BEC yet, and I don't ever expect to. The beauty is that tomorrow's could take first place. I also find it anchoring to accept each sandwich as it is, and not let the good be the enemy of the perfect. This is a lesson I have to constantly relearn. It is, of course, not really about sandwiches.

I'm worried about the winter. I worry that I won't continue to put time into personal projects like this site, that I'll let myself be too distracted, that I'll wallow.

But there's a certain alchemy that happens when you mix time with grief. And luckily, it doesn't always require conscious effort; it continues mercifully behind the scenes.

You can read books and see a therapist and talk to friends. You can go out too late and have bad dates and try to be a better kid to your parents, a better friend to your friends, a better ex to your exes. You can be vulnerable with others, and hope for their vulnerability in return.

You can take yourself to the precise edge of your own comfort and reason, and the next morning, you can peel yourself out of bed and go order a BEC.

Just don't eat it at home.
